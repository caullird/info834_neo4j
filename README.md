# 🦸‍♀️🏙️ TP2 - Neo4J

The objective of this tutorial is to discover the Neo4j environment with the use of different datasets

As the time for this exercise was only 4 hours, we were not able to exploit all the possibilities with all our data and potential new data

## 👀 Quick overview of our project 

### 🦹 Superhero data (from Avengers)

We have established links between the superhero genre! A first approach to imagine new links with more information (appearance in the movies ..)
